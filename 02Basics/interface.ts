// interface is like a class where you can define variable(properties) and mathod without it's body
// Every thing define in interface you have to provide this when you use or extend this like if you define variabel and method then you have to provide that with define type in interface.
// The optiocal('?') variable and method  that you define in inteface that is not compulsory to use in where you extends or type you provide
// Example : the operating system is like inteface for hardware it doesn't allow you that what happen when you click button(key) how does it happen you don't know and you don't care about it. you know that is workingğŸ˜‚
